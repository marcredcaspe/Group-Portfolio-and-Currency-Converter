Project Information:
We have made a group portfolio that introduces our group members and the currency converter web app that our group developed. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of an API as well as the implementation of error-handling logic for it through the use of a currency converter web app. We obtained an API key from another online site and used JavaScript to establish the API connection from our site to the other.
